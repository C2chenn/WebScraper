# This is what the cs103spider will do to get what you need.
# add more comments later explaining what we will do.
# also add better docstrings
# This spider so far can extract the urls for the notes. 
# IMPORTANT everythign has handout in url find a way to classify handouts specifically
# actually do you need the hadnouts? 
# for now i just created a list of the links (if my syntax is correct)
# later add in how to download using pdf
# everytime you tell the spider to crawl delete excel file. 
# run the command scrapy crawl cs103 -o items.csv -t csv to create excel file. 
# also there is probably a more efficient way to do this.
